* Learned more about NumPy

## Vectorization in NumPy

* Define the term vectorization, as it is used in the context of Python/NumPy
* Prescribe the use of NumPy's vectorized functions for performing optimized numerical computations on arrays
* Compare the performance of a simple non-vectorized computation to a vectorized one
* Describe how unary, binary, and sequential functions are defined on NumPy arrays
* Provide a brief overview of linear algebra functions and logical operations

* The ND-array can be utilized in mathematical expressions to perform mathematical computations using an array's entries
* In general, NumPy implements mathematical functions such that, when a function acts on an array, the mathematical operating is applied to each entry in the array
* Recall that NumPy's ND-arrays are homogeneous: an array can only contain data of a single type
* In the context of high-level languages like Python, Matlab, and R, the term **vectorization** describes the use of optimized, pre-compiled code written in a low-level language to perform mathematical operations over a sequence of data.
* In other words, you can directly apply mathematical operations to NumPy arrays
* NumPy has different mathematical functions:
  * Unary functions: f(x)
  * Binary functions: f(x, y)
  * Functions that operate on sequences of numbers: $f(\{x_i\}_{i=0}^{n-1})$ 
* An unary function is a mathematical function that accepts one operand (i.e. argument)
* Binary functions take in two arrays
* You can apply binary NumPy functions to arrays of unlike shapes. For instance, you may want to add a single-shape-(2,) array with ten of such arrays, which are stored as a single shape-(10,2) array, known as **broadcasting**.
* The `axis` argument specifies which axis NumPy can traverse on. If X is an N-dimensional array, and j axes are specified with the `axis` keyword argument for a sequential NumPy function, then a N - j-dimensional 

## Broadcasting in NumPy

* NumPy provides a mechanism for performing mathematical operations on array of *unequal* shapes
* Rules of broadcasting
  * Arrays are broadcast-comptible if they satisfy either of the following conditions: the aligned dimensions have the same size or one of the dimensions has a size of 1
