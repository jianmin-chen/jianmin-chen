### Relaxation method: Problem #2

This is a continuation of yesterday's problems regarding the relaxation method.

> Our current implementation of the relaxation method is quite crude in that we must specify the number of iterations that it performs, and then simply look at the output to see if we have converged to a fix-point. It would instead be better if we could have our algorithm check its own numbers to see if they are converging to a single value, and then terminate itself if it has converged.
> 
> We can measure how close our most recent guess is to a fixed-point by looking at our most recent three guesses, like:
```math
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{n} = \lvert\frac{(x_n - x_{n-1})^2}{2x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} - x_{n}}\rvert
\end{equation}
```

```python
def relaxation_method2(func, xo, tol, max_it):
    """ Performs the relaxation method to find a fixed-point for `func`,
        given the initial guess `xo`. The relaxation process is carried out for
        `num_it` steps.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        func : Callable[[float], float]
            The function whose fixed point is being found.
        xo : float
            The initial "guess" value.
        tol : float
            A positive value that sets the maximum permissable error
            in the final fixed-point estimate.
        max_it : int
            The maximum number relaxation-guesses (i.e. the length of the
            list you are creating) allotted before the 
            algorithm will end. The length of the list you return should
            never exceed this number.
            
        Returns
        -------
        List[float]
            A list of the initial guess, and all of the subsequent guesses generated
            by the relaxation method. """
    relax = [xo]
    for i in range(1, max_it + 1):
        xo = func(xo)
        relax.append(xo)
        if i >= 1:
            if (2 * relax[i - 1] - relax[i - 2] - xo) == 0:
                den = 10 ** -14
            else:
                den = 2 * relax[i - 1] - relax[i - 2] - xo
            if abs((xo - relax[i - 1]) ** 2 / den) <= tol:
                break
    return relax[:max_it]
```

### Ciphers: Problem #1

Write a function that takes as input a string and shift amount and returns the string encoded using a Caesar cipher with the specified shift. Your function should:

* Only replace letters; leaving numbers, punctuations, and whitespace alone
* Order the alphabet from lowercase to uppercase

```python
def encode_caesar(string, shift_amt):
    ''' Encodes the specified `string` using a Caesar cipher with shift `shift_amt`
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        string : str
            The string to encode.
        
        shift_amt : int
            How much to shift the alphabet by.
        
        Returns
        -------
        str
            The encoded string.
       '''
    shiftkey = [chr(i) for i in range(65, 91)] + [chr(i) for i in range(97, 123)]
    res = ""
    for letter in string:
        if not letter in shiftkey:
            res += letter
        else:
            shift = shiftkey.index(letter) + shift_amt
            if shift < len(shiftkey):
                res += shiftkey[shift]
            else:
                res += shiftkey[shift % len(shiftkey)]
    return res
```

### Ciphers: Problem #2

A keyword cipher (or substitution cipher) is another cryptographic function. Rather than shift the alphabet by some fixed amount like the Caesar cipher, the keyword cipher shifts the alphabet based on a keyword or phrase. Suppose our keyphrase is

```
beaverworks is cool
```

and we want to encode the string

```
python rules
```

Like the Caesar cipher, we'll build a substitution alphabet. We'll go through our keyphrase and record the unique letters, than append the rest of the alphabet. Then we can make a straightforward substitution for each letter in our string.

#### Breaking the keyword cipher

You might be thinking that this is more difficult to decrypt than our Ceasar cipher if we don't know the keyword, and you'd be right, since there are `403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000` permutations of the alphabet, just lowercase letters. Practically, this is where things like frequency analysis come into play, where if we have encoded text we can look at the frequency of each letter and try to match these to known frequencies of English. 

Write a function that takes as input a string and a keyword (or phrase) and returns the string encoded using a keyword cipher. Your function should:

* Only replace letters; leaving numbers, punctuation, and whitespace alone
* Ignore case, using only lowercase letters

```python
def encode_keyword(string, keyword):
    ''' Encodes the specified `string` using a Keyword cipher with keyword `keyword`.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        string : str
            The string to encode.
        
        keyword : str
            The keyword to use in the substitution alphabet.
        
        Returns
        -------
        str
            The encoded string.
       '''
    # student code goes here
    shiftkey = [chr(i) for i in range(97, 123)]
    keyword = keyword.lower()
    unique = []
    for i in range(len(keyword)):
        curr = keyword[i]
        if curr in shiftkey and keyword.index(curr) == i:
            # First occurence
            unique.append(curr)
    for i in shiftkey:
        if i not in unique:
            unique.append(i)
    res = ""
    for i in string:
        if i in shiftkey:
            index = shiftkey.index(i)
            res += unique[index]
        else:
            res += i
    return res
```

### Matplotlib

* Designed to work nicely with NumPy arrays, and natively uses 2- and 3- dimensional arrays to represent images (gray scale and RGB)
* Included in Anaconda
* `pyplot` submodule contains all of the essential plotting functionality
* Use abbreviation `plt` like `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
* To use Matplotlib in a Jupyter Noteboook, use `%matplotlib notebook`

#### Snippets

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Creating a figure that contains a single set of axes. `plt.subplots()` returns the tuple: (Figure-instance, Axes-instance)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
```

* Executing this code will open a figure with a blank set of axes
* We can use the `Axes` instance, `ax`, to plot data, add labels and a title to the plot, and add grid lines
* The `Figure` instance, `fig`, controls higher-level features of the figure, such as the layout of the axes, the alignment of labels, and other factors

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Prepare 50 x-coordinates and 50 y-coordinates
x = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 50) # 50 evenly spaced points between -pi and pi
y = np.sin(x)

ax.plot(x, y)
fig.savefig("sinewave_plt.png");  # Semicolon merely suppresses output to console
```
