Hi! I'm writing this at almost 3:00 in the morning. I know, crazy right? I've been at [Horizon](https://horizon.hackclub.com) since Friday, helping to run an amazing hackathon! We'll be touring NYC tomorrow (well, really, I'll be visiting my old hometown since I grew up in NYC), but here's what I've been doing so far!

On Friday:

* Arrived
* Had breakfast at this lovely cafe in Tribeca
* Went to the Nat. Museum of Math
* Went to Girls Who Code CodeFair
* Had lunch at Cava
* Set up venue at Girl Scouts HQ
* Got pizza in SoHo
* Went to sleep at like 10

Today:

* Woke up at 5
* Went directly to Girl Scouts HQ
* Ran Horizon! Got [Neopixel music project](https://github.com/jianmin-chen/spotify-collab) to work + got to help out Girl Scouts. Literally the sweetest little kids I've seen.
* Had dinner with some super influential women! My favorite was Sara Chipps, probably because conversation with her felt more natural than conversations with some of the other people. (Which is not to disparage the others! They were all so cool!)
* 20 minute walk up to Times Square. So ethereal at night
* Got back home around 12:15 in the morning
