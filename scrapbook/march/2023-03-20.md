I'm planning to get the following done today:

* Finish HC's transfer application
* Finish building music queue for [Horizon](https://horizon.hackclub.com)

I also want to cover a little more of machine learning and take more notes, but we'll see.

Here's what I ended up doing today:

* Took notes on AI and machine learning (at the bottom)
* As well as some notes on other BWSI stuff

For BWSI I put UAV as my second course, so I'm copy-pasting some notes I did on it!

* Most commerical AUVs are modular by design so that they can be configured for specific missions. The modular design is needed due to the limited space onboard to carry extraneous components
* BWSI focuses on robo-submarine type AUVs that are designed to swim forward only
* Parts of a UAV:
    * Propeller
    * Fins
    * GPS WiFi medium
    * Strobe light
    * Bottom profiler
    * GoPro
    * Acoustic Doppler current profiler
    * Turbulence sensor
    * Forward looking sonar
    * Acoustic modem
    * CTD sensor
* Control surfaces
    * Distributed around the AUV body are a collection of appendages, sometimes called fins, winds or rudders. The design and placements of these fins is the result of complex physics models
    * For now, the important facts to know about these fins is that some of them are stability surfaces and others are control surfaces
        * Stability surfaces serve to ensure that the AUV maintains a level smooth trajectory, even when it is fighting undersea currents or surface wave effects.
        * Control surfaces, on the other hand, are designed to rotate to cause the vehicle to turn, dive, or ascend to the surface. The control surfaces are typically near the tail of the UAV.    
    * Propeller controls whether AUV is moving or not, and how fast it moves through the water column. For most purposes, fixed speed works
* Sensors
    * AUVs can carry wide variety of sensors that are suited to its intended mission
    * Underwater cameras
* Command and control
    * Comes in two layers:
    * The vehicle controller: usually comes as part of the commercial AUV and enables a user to reliably tell the AUV how to execute a pre-planned mission
        * Typically has well-tested functions to steer the vehicle from waypoint to waypoint, to change speeds, or to travel in a fixed direction and/or speed for a length of time
        * Number of safety features implemented by the manufacturer, like aborting a mission
* Navigation
    * Even though there is no GPS, AUVs still use a GPS antenna to determine locations safe to ascend to the surface. (Common safety procedure)
    * During underwater segment, an AUV may use an inertial navigation system, which integrates ownship accelerations to provide a positional estimate with a slowly growing positional error as a function of time
    * May be aided by a system of transponder buoys that are in known fixed locations to serve as short-range underwater GOS
* Communication
    * While underwater, typical communication is an acoustic modem, since sounds travels far better underwater than electromagnetic waves.
    * On surface, can use WiFi antenna for short-range communications and an iridium satellite communications antenna for long-range communications
* Strobe light for safety

### Essential nautical terms

Boating vocab!

* Port bow, port beam, port quarter is on left side when facing front (port has same # of letters as *left*)
* Starboard bow, starboard beam, starboard quarter is on right side when facing front
* *Ahead* and *astern* are used to describe movement. Ahead = forward, astern = backward
* Sharp end at front = bow, back = stern
* Beam of a vessel is "traditionally where the largest deck beam extended across the widest point of the ship from one side of the hull to the other.
    * Sailing yacht: Mast (in the middle)
    * Speedboats: Towards the back
* Midships: Middle of boat
* Quarters are located *abaft* (behind) the "Beam" and forward of the "Stern" on either side of the vessel
* Direction from the vessel
    * "Shipwreck 45 degrees off the port bow" means 45 degrees between the port bow and the port beam
    * "Starboard 90 degrees" = starboard beam
* *Windward* and *leeward*: Towards and away from wind, respectively
* When sailing with wind coming over the port side of a sailing vessel it is said to be on a *port tack* vs. *starboard tack*. We can change direction by making a *tacking* maneuver.
* Helmsman is the person who typically steers the ship. Conning office r will repeat the given command

### Vehicle Types

* Deep Submergence Vehicle (DSV): a vehicle that operates at extreme depths and pressures typical of the deep ocean
* Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)
* Piloted or Human Operated Vehicle (HOV)
* Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV)
* Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)

I also took some notes on math!

### Vectors

* Vector = magnitude + direction
* Speed is a scalar, but velocity is a vector.
* Vectors are represented on papers with an arrow above or are bolded, but can also have be represented by column notation like so:
```math
\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} 
```
* Top coordinate is horizontal direction, bottom is vertical direction
* Magnitude of a vector is basically Pythagorean's theorem
* Multiple dimensions is possible!
* Multiplying a vector by a scalar

### Real coordinate spaces

* Real coordinate space is represented by the symbol $\mathbb{R}^2$ (R with bolded left leg), and it's basically what it seems - the real coordinate values of a vector
* The two in the math notation above basically means "this is a 2-dimensional real coordinate space"
* All of the real possible 2-tuples

Now we get to AI. I worked on reading [this](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) articles today.

* Four separate factors that hold back AI:
   * Compute
   * Data
   * Algorithms
   * Infrastructire
* Reinforcement learning
* Example: Pong
* We receive an image frame (a 210x160x3 byte array - integers from 0 to 255 giving pixel values) and we get to decide if we want to move the paddle up or down. 
* After every single choice the game simulator executes the action and gives us a reward - either a +1 if ball went past the opponent, a -1 if we missed the ball, or 0 otherwise
* Goal is to move the paddle so we get lots of reward
* First, we're going to define a policy network that implements our player (or "agent"). Network will take state of the game and decide what we should do (move up or down)
* We will use the probability of moving up (a stochastic policy or something)
![](http://karpathy.github.io/assets/rl/policy.png)
* It sounds kind of imppossible. Suppose that we decide to move up. The game might respond that we get 0 reward this time step and gives us another 100,800 numbers the next frame. How can we tell what made getting a reward happen then? We call this the _credit assignment problem_.
* Before we dive into the policy gradients solution... in ordinary supervised learning we would feed an image to the network and get some probabilities, e.g. for two classes UP and DOWN
   * In supervised learning we would have a label. For example, we might be told that the correct thing to do is to go up
   * So when it sees a similar image in the future, our network will be more likely to move in the past direction
* What if we don't have the correct label? Here we use the Policy Gradients solution, where we start out with a probability, like UP = 30% and DOWN = 70%, and sample an action from this distribution.
* Policy gradients: Run a policy for a while. See what actions led to high rewards. Increase their probability.
![](http://karpathy.github.io/assets/rl/episodes.png)
* Cartoon diagram of 4 games. Each black circle is some game state (three example states are visualized on the bottom), and each arrow is a transition, annotated with the action that was sampled. In this case we won 2 games and lost 2 games. With policy gradients we would take the two games we won and slightly encourage every single action we made in that episode. Conversely, we would also take the two games we lost and slightly discourage every single action in that episode

### Thoughts

Holy heck have I learned a sh** ton about AI and specifically machine learning. I've learned about perceptrons, sigmoid neurons, how neural networks work, nearest neighbor classification (KNN), conventional neural networks, and a little bit of RNNs (which I still can't really understand, Karpathy's article on it wasn't very clear) and reinforcement learning. There's only so much you can learn at time without forgetting though haha.
